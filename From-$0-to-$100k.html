										<h1>From $0 to $100k: What Nobody Tells You About Making Money Online
</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>At the end of 2019, I had no money, a laptop, and a dream: to make money online. A dream shared by many. But how did I achieve it?</p>

									<p><b>Discover and experiment with new alternatives.</b>
</p>


									<h2>Digital Artist</h2>	

									<p>I experimented with anything that required little investment and could be done from home. I built websites and explored selling them, gaining valuable experience. I sold food for delivery, participated in raffles, sold concert tickets on Twitter, and even took items to the flea market to sell. I also worked as a programmer from home for six months without a college degree, learning from YouTube tutorials (even though I wasn’t very skilled at it). Then, I lost my job due to the pandemic.</p>

									<p>I decided to explore bitcoin trading, albeit only with fake money. I was confident in my knowledge, yet the truth was that I had no idea what I was doing. However, this decision led me to read hundreds of articles about cryptocurrencies, and that’s when I discovered the world of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), where some individuals were making thousands of dollars selling digital art. I told myself, “I want to do this.”</p>

									

									<h2>Blockchain and NFTs</h2>
									<p>NFTs are unique digital objects you can own, sell, or trade on the internet. The term NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Although it sounds complicated, let me break it down simply:</p>
									<ol>
									  <li><strong>Non-fungible</strong> means it is unique and cannot be replaced by something of equal value. Imagine a rare collectible card or a drawing; you can’t exchange it for another exactly the same.</li>
									  <li><strong>Token</strong> is a digital object recorded on the blockchain. The <strong>blockchain is like a giant ledger where all transactions are securely stored, ensuring no one can cheat.</li>
									</ol>


									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									  
									    <p>I created an artist profile, polished an artistic resume (yes, fake it till you make it), and applied to several online art galleries. I spent months honing my skills and studying the market until I sold over 20 digital art pieces.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										
									    <p>Becoming involved in the art community helped me acquire artwork in raffles or purchase it at low prices. Months later, these pieces were appreciated, and I gained significant profits. Although the landscape of digital art and NFTs has evolved, their relevance continues to grow year after year.</p>

												<h2>How can you achieve something like this?</h2>
												<p>To get started in this world, you need the following:</p>
												<ul>
												  <li><strong>Create digital art:</strong> It doesn't matter what type of art or technique you use. Whether you're a painter, a 3D artist, or working with AI, any form of digital art can find a place.</li>
												  <li><strong>A cryptocurrency wallet:</strong> I recommend using Metamask or Phantom. Download the extensions and store your secret phrase securely, preferably on paper. This is the key to your wallet, anyone who has it can access your funds.</li>
												  <li><strong>Some capital:</strong> At least $5 in cryptocurrency. You can use platforms like Binance or Bitso to buy crypto.</li>
												  <li><strong>Tokenize your art:</strong> You'll need to create NFTs with your art on platforms like OpenSea or Magic Eden. If you want a more detailed guide, leave a comment.</li>
												  <li><strong>A social media profile:</strong> X (formerly Twitter) is the most important network for the NFT and crypto world. Get involved in the community and promote your art creatively.</li>
												</ul>

												<h2>Professional Video Game Player</h2>

												<span class="image main"><img src="images/33.jpg" alt="" /></span>

												<p>After my time as a digital artist, I took a new turn in my career and became a professional video game player. I call it "professional" because I managed to generate enough income to live off it.</p>
												<p>It all started when I discovered a game called Axie Infinity, players could earn money simply by playing and selling in-game characters, which were also NFTs. Once again, I told myself, "I want this."</p>

												<h2>How Did I Do It?</h2>
												<p>First, I exchanged digital artworks for Axies, which allowed me to gather 16 Axies through deals and trades with other players. But what are Axies? Essentially, they are in-game characters that also function as NFTs. Imagine them as Pokémon; however, to play and earn cryptocurrency.</p>
												<p>Over time, I became one of the top players, managing a team of over 40 people and creating an Axie farm, where I bred and sold them on the marketplace. I succeeded in making a living by playing video games and managing my team.</p>

												<h2>Would You Like to Do It Too? Here’s How:</h2>
												<ul>
												  <li><strong>Get a Digital Wallet:</strong> Just like with NFTs and digital art, you need a digital wallet. Depending on the game, the wallet varies. Always remember to store your secret phrase offline and in a secure place.</li>
												  <li><strong>Study Game Strategies:</strong> Every video game has different approaches to earning cryptocurrency. The strategies will determine whether you can generate significant or minimal profits.</li>
												  <li><strong>Try Various Games:</strong> Have fun while playing, learn, and improve your skills. Not all games will be suitable for you, so take the time to try several before deciding.</li>
												  <li><strong>Choose Wisely:</strong> After trying various games, be selective and choose those that best fit your needs and play style.</li>
												</ul>


									

									

									<h2>NFT Trading</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/44.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>After a year immersed in web3 gaming markets, digital art, and NFTs, I acquired extensive knowledge of trading these environments. I selected artists and video games and traded their artworks and NFTs, including digital lands, characters, and in-game items.</p>

										<h2>Would You Like to Learn How? Here’s What to Do:</h2>
										<ul>
										  <li><strong>Download a Digital Wallet:</strong> This will be your main tool for buying, selling, and storing your NFTs. Choose one that works with the network and projects that interest you.</li>
										  <li><strong>Study the Market:</strong> Filter projects and artists with potential, selecting the highest chances of success and high transaction volume. In the case of video games, NFT prices can fluctuate significantly. For example, their value may increase due to major updates, special events, or collaborations. However, the price can also drop when projects fail to meet expectations, if the game lacks a solid economy, or if it struggles with its marketing. Important: Only invest what you can afford to lose, as this is a high-risk market.</li>
										  <li><strong>Have a Strategic Plan:</strong> Define a goal for your investments. You may opt to sell within a specific timeframe, such as X months following a major update, or take a long-term risk if you have data to support your decision. Having a plan will help you manage risks and seize opportunities.</li>
										  <li><strong>Take Advantage of Rewarding Platforms:</strong> Some platforms reward you for using them, granting points that can later be converted into cryptocurrencies distributed through Airdrops. Later, I will explain how Airdrops work and how to maximize your earnings from them.</li>
										</ul>

										<h2>Important Note:</h2>
										<p>NFTs were a massive sensation in 2021-2022, but cycles and trends change. Always stay informed and alert to new developments in the market.</p>

										<h2>Meme Coins: The New Trend</h2>
										<p>Many NFTs were quirky or funny drawings that, ironically, were worth a lot of money. Today, meme coins are the ones moving the most capital. These cryptocurrencies are absurd, entertaining, satirical, and often political, appearing and disappearing daily. They are high-risk investments, and their trading strategies differ from those of NFTs.</p>
										<p>Unlike more serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins usually lack a practical purpose. However, they can become famous due to the hype or publicity they receive, especially if celebrities or influencers mention them. They function like a viral phenomenon: many people buy in the expectation that others will follow suit, leading to a price increase.</p>

										<h2>Would you like to learn how to trade meme coins? Here are some steps to get started:</h2>
										<ul>
										  <li><strong>Get a digital wallet:</strong> I recommend Phantom for trading on the Solana network; its transactions are very inexpensive, and it’s where most meme coins are traded.</li>
										  <li><strong>Fund your wallet with Solana cryptocurrencies:</strong> You can buy Solana on platforms like Binance, Bitso, or with a debit/credit card. To start practicing and learning, you can use $10 or less. Important: only invest what you’re willing to lose, as this represents a very high risk.</li>
										  <li><strong>Study and learn how to analyze meme coins:</strong> Plan a strategy and be very selective with the meme coins you choose. Always remember to take profits when possible.</li>
										  <li><strong>Use tools like Dexscreener:</strong> View charts and analyze the coins. It’s also advisable to use RugCheck to identify meme coins with suspicious contracts that could potentially steal your money.</li>
										  <li><strong>Trade meme coins only if you have extra money and can afford to lose it:</strong> Among all the options for making money online, this one carries the highest risk.</li>
										</ul>


											<h2>Airdrops: How to Get Free Cryptocurrencies</h2>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/55.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Over the years, I have received magical money from the internet, also known as cryptocurrencies, completely for free, simply for being a user of crypto projects.</p>
											<p>Imagine you’re at a party, and suddenly someone starts throwing gifts into the air; anyone at the party can catch them. A cryptocurrency airdrop is quite similar; however, instead of physical gifts, it involves digital coins or tokens.</p>
											<p>When a cryptocurrency company wants to promote a new project or coin, they sometimes give away those coins to people without asking for anything in return. These coins are sent directly to users' digital wallets. But who receives these "gifts"? Generally, people already using that cryptocurrency, have participated in previous projects, or meet certain requirements, such as holding a minimum amount of another cryptocurrency in their wallet.</p>

											<h2>Why do they do it?</h2>
											<ul>
											  <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> Companies want more people to know about their project, and what better way than to offer something for free?</li>
											  <li><strong>Building a community:</strong> By giving away tokens, they hope people will become more interested in their project and possibly become long-term users or investors.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In summary, airdrops are like cryptocurrency giveaways that companies send to attract more people and generate interest in their projects. It’s like receiving free digital money!</p>

											<h2>Would you like to know how to participate in airdrops? Here are some steps:</h2>

											<h2>Find Airdrops</h2>
											<p>Stay informed about projects that will be launching airdrops soon. Many cryptocurrency platforms and social media networks, such as Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, often announce these events. There are also specialized websites that publish lists of airdrops, such as CoinMarketCap, AirdropAlert, and Airdrops.io</p>

											<h2>Meet the Requirements</h2>
											<p>Each airdrop usually has specific rules. Some will only ask that you have a compatible digital wallet on the network where the airdrop will be launched, such as MetaMask, Phantom, or Trust Wallet. Others may require you to complete certain tasks, such as:</p>
											<ul>
											  <li>Following their social media accounts.</li>
											  <li>Joining their Telegram or Discord channel.</li>
											  <li>Retweeting or sharing information about the project.</li>
											  <li>Using one of their platforms (such as staking or interacting with dApps).</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The more actively you participate, the greater your chances of receiving valuable airdrops.</p>

											<h2>Receive and Sell Your Tokens</h2>
											<p>Once you receive the airdrop tokens in your wallet, you can choose between two main paths:</p>
											<ul>
											  <li><strong>Hodl (hold them):</strong> If you believe the value of those tokens will increase over time, you can wait and sell them when their price is higher.</li>
											  <li><strong>Sell Immediately:</strong> Many choose to sell the tokens shortly after the airdrop, as some projects experience a strong initial surge before the price tends to drop. In this case, you could sell them on platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or any exchange where the token is available.</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Beware of Scams</h2>
											<p>While legitimate airdrops can be a great opportunity to make money, there are also many phishing attempts or scams where airdrops are sent to steal your funds or personal information. Be cautious:</p>
											<ul>
											  <li>Never give out your private keys.</li>
											  <li>Be wary of projects that ask you to send money to receive the airdrop.</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Diversification</h2>
											<p>Don't limit yourself to a single airdrop. Participate in multiple ones to increase your chances of receiving valuable tokens. Some airdrops have been extremely profitable; for example, the Uniswap (PAINT) airdrop in 2020 distributed over $5,000 in tokens to the platform's early users. Imagine if you had been there!</p>
											<p>With consistency and knowledge, airdrops can provide you with an interesting passive income in the crypto world.</p>

											<h2>Conclusion</h2>
											<p>In conclusion, the world of crypto and gaming offers a variety of exciting opportunities to make money online, from playing and trading NFTs to participating in airdrops and exploring the trends of meme coins. While each option comes with challenges and risks, with the right information and a strategic approach, you can take advantage of these possibilities in a fun and creative way. Remember, these are just a few of the many ways to generate income on the Internet, and the most important thing is to enjoy the process while learning and exploring new alternatives. The future is promising and full of possibilities!</p>
