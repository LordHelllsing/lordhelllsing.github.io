										<h1>From NFTs to Meme coins: The Trend Shift in the Crypto Space and Some Tips</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Whether you know about crypto or not, I’m sure you remember that a few years ago, NFTs—those JPGs of cartoon monkeys, neither particularly beautiful nor ugly—were worth more than your house. And they weren’t the only ones; many other JPGs sold for thousands of dollars. Not long ago, many felt like economic experts, buying pixel art of owls, anime characters, or tokenized art from artists. But in the end, the only true experts were the few who sold their JPGs and kept the money. Oh, beautiful economy!</p>

									<p>I remember 2020 when I won an NFT by Xcopy (one of the most popular artists now, but not so much then) and sold it for $750. A year later, that JPG was worth around $40k…
</p>


									<h2>Things have changed drastically in a couple of years.</h2>	

									<p>A large portion of the money that was in NFTs has shifted to another trend: Meme coins! Meme cryptocurrencies are born and die every day, at all hours and every second.</p>

									<p>NFTs have a little problem: someone has to buy your NFT for you to make money. How can we solve this liquidity issue? The answer is Memecoins! You can get your money the moment you want to sell. They are very high-risk assets, so you have to be skilled and quick. In such a fast-moving market with a lot of liquidity, capital flows from one meme coin to another. In this market, every second is like a day in the stock market, so if you want to make money and are willing to take high risks, I recommend these options</p>

									<h2>Study, make mistakes, learn from them, and choose a strategy; for example:</h2>
									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									    <h2>Memes with millions in market cap</h2> 
									    <p>Don’t buy green candles; wait for the price to drop, be very selective, and never cling to any meme. Always take profits and minimize your losses.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h2> First-phase bullish memes</h2>  
									    <p>You can use Pump Fun. I recommend learning about slippage; don’t underestimate transaction fees, especially on small trades. Adopting a profit-first mentality helps you secure gains by taking profits before a coin’s value drops.</p>
									    </div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h2>Second-phase meme coins</h2> 
									    <p>These are the ones that have already had a bullish phase and have crashed by 60-90%. Trade in their second bullish phase; you can use Dexscreener to filter by market cap, volume, and transactions, among others. Also, use RugCheck to ensure you aren’t scammed by fraudulent memecoin contracts.</p>
									    </div>

									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

									  <h2>All in or nothing (gambling)</h2> 
									    <p>if you like the casino and want to gamble hard, you can do it with your favorite meme too, but the most likely outcome is that you’ll lose everything.</p>
									
											</div>
										</div>

												<h2>Memecoins have the rhythm of generations glued to their screens.</h2>
												<p>Every day, thousands of meme coins are born and die; it’s a factory that continuously moves money in waves through various trends, and as you navigate them, you start to see the narratives and how they change cyclically.</p>
									
												<h2></h2>
												<p>What do I like about meme coins? They are a reflection of what people perceive as the economy. If throughout history many people have invented their currency, then anyone can do it. And respecting the principles that a currency must be backed by something, well, memes, like debt, are backing that people accept, buy, and sell.</p>
												<p>Long live meme coins!</p>
